////
Base the file name and the ID on the module title. For example:
* file name: con-my-concept-module-a.adoc
* ID: [id="con-my-concept-module-a_{context}"]
* Title: = My concept module A
////

////
Indicate the module type in one of the following
ways:
Add the prefix con- or con_ to the file name.
Add the following attribute before the module ID:
////
:_content-type: CONCEPT

////
The ID is an anchor that links to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken.

The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID so you can include it multiple times in the same guide.

[id="con_facts-and-nic-filtering_{context}"]
= Facts and NIC filtering

Facts are host parameters such as total memory, operating system version, or architecture.
You can find Facts in *Monitor* > *Facts* and search hosts via facts or use facts in templates.

In {Project}, collect facts from following various sources:

* `subscription manager`
* `ansible`
* `puppet`

{Project} is an inventory system for hosts and network interfaces.
For hypervisors or container hosts, it does not make any value to add thousands of interfaces per host into the inventory and update it every few minutes.
For each individual NIC reported, Foreman creates a NIC entry and those entries are never removed from the database.
Parsing all the facts and comparing all records in the database makes {Project} extremely slow and unusable.
To optimize the performance of various actions, most importantly fact import, use options available in *Administer* > *Settings* > *Facts*.
