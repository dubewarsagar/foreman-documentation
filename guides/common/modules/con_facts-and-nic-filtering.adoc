= Facts and NIC filtering

Facts are host parameters such as total memory, operating system version, or architecture.
You can find facts in *Monitor* > *Facts* and search hosts through facts or use facts in templates.

In {Project}, collect facts from following various sources:

* `subscription manager`
* `ansible`
* `puppet`

{Project} is an inventory system for hosts and network interfaces.
For hypervisors or container hosts, adding thousands of interfaces per host and updating the inventory every few minutes is inadequate.
For each individual NIC reported, {Project} creates a NIC entry and those entries are never removed from the database.
Parsing all the facts and comparing all records in the database makes {Project} extremely slow and unusable.
To optimize the performance of various actions, most importantly fact import, you can use the options available in *Administer* > *Settings* > *Facts*.
